    "content": "Hi guys, I saw some people using Autonomous workflows on this Sub and YouTube.   \nBut what I don't understand is how people are trusting what this Autonomous AI agent is developing. Since whole flow is AI driven, and you check the output once its done, by the time you check the correctness, it has already spent a lot of tokens. \n\nYesterday I asked claude to debug some flaky tests, it created some document. Then I passed that document to another subagent asking to verify the document, but that subagent spent 90k tokens, and basically looked at the multiple source files (which is ok) and said that the document is correct, which it wasn't. So by the end of session, it spent \\~250k tokens. So time and money wasted. \n\n",

I was installing some open source software with help from Claude, one configuration kept not quite doing what i thought it should do and without hesitation Claude jumped to the code side of the fence and just changed it to fit my wish. recompile and there it was, just the way i wanted it.\n\nThis made me realize that AI + open source is a different story entirely. The code being open is what makes it possible to change, but having AI help navigate and modify it is what makes it practical.\n\n\n\nThose little issues that were always technically fixable but not worth the cognitive overhead? Now they actually get fixed. The \"you can customize it yourself\" promise stopped being theoretical and became real.\n\n\n\nJust",

    "content": "I've recently written many skills to enable Claude Code to support various APIs, such as Firecrawl, Hacker News, [fal.ai](http://fal.ai), and so on. I found that making Claude Code use skills stably is a challenging thing. \n\nFor example:\n\n1. If a skill depends on scripts, tools that the scripts depend on is not always available in the environment. Therefore, a general-purpose skill should only depend on simple toolchains as much as possible, such as curl only. This causes the content used to describe APIs in skills to become very verbose.\n\n2. Claude Code has a bug with VAR substitution in shell commands. You cannot use `$VAR` together with pipeline, you must wrap it with `bash -c`. This causes extremely complex escaping issues when generating JSON body with `curl -d`.\n\n3. Automated testing is very difficult. \n\n4. Without automated testing, there is no way to know when SaaS platform APIs have changed.\n\n  \nCurious if others have found better patterns for writing stable skills. Any tips?",

Memories have activation levels that decay over time, and accessing them strengthens recall - like human memory.\n\nKey features:\n\n\\- Spreading activation through a knowledge graph\n\n\\- Project-aware boosting (active work stays fresh)\n\n\\- Disaster recovery (snapshot/rollback your AI's working state)\n\n\\- 18 MCP tools, all running locally\n\nNo cloud, no subscriptions - your data stays on your machine.\n\nBuilding toward a Kickstarter launch in January.

The problem is that VSCode does not notify me when Claude needs input: confirm the next step, approve an action, or answer a question.\n\n\n\nWhat happens in practice is that after 10 seconds Claude may be waiting for permission to access a folder (even though \"auto-approve\" is enabled), and it just sits idle until I randomly return to VSCode.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to make VSCode send native macOS notifications when Claude Code requires attention?

To be clear, I'm already using this and other standard CC features.  My question is more about CC being annoyingly sensitive to small variations of what's in there.  Thanks again.\n\n## Second Edit\n\nI ended up solving this with a hook and a Python script that checks regexes.  I'm liking it.\n\n## Thoughts\n\nI'd be happy to permit `timeout * pytest *` but it seems like CC doesn't accept that kind of permission.

    "content": "i love claude code, it’s basically replaced my junior devs, but there is this one specific thing that drives me absolutely insane. you are in the flow, 2 hours deep, building something complex, and suddenly it just... breaks. it forgets the file structure, it starts hallucinating imports that don’t exist, and it loses the plot on the architecture.\n\nit feels like digital dementia. i realized the issue is not the context window size, it’s basically the \"context rot\", the model gets saturated with chatter and loses the hard references to the codebase.\n\nso i stopped waiting for anthropic to fix it and built a workaround. i call it CMP (context memory protocol), basically it runs locally, scans the AST of your project, and forces a deterministic map of the state into every request. it anchors the model so it *can't* hallucinate the structure. i’ve been using it for a week and it’s kinda wild, i can go 4+ hours in a single session and it stays sharp.",

But I always end up switching back to Claude as the serious coding model.\n\nIf this somehow isn't really the case for Gemini Flash 3 this time and it holds up to the hype, then that ability combined with the mimo-v2-flash capabilities would seemingly put Anthropic into red alert territory in terms of catching up on affordability.\n\nThe fact that I haven't really done the much testing on the Gemini 3 Flash edits from yesterday and ",

No warning, no explanation just a message saying \"Organization disabled.\"\n\nI’ve tried everything to get this fixed:\n\n1. I wrote to support multiple times. Their only response was that they \"couldn't help\" because the subscription was handled through Apple.   \n\n2. I filed a formal appeal to the account recovery department. Rejected.\n\n2.I’ve followed up repeatedly for 3 months and have been met with total silence or canned \"we can't help\" responses.\n\nSo now, I’m out €20, I have no access to the service I paid for, and Anthropic refuses to even tell me why I was banned or help me get a refund.\n\nI’m honestly terrified to think what would have happened if I had signed up for a Team/Max plan",

Lately even with a new thread it will get part of the way through its \"thinking\" steps, then just stop responding. Sometimes it happens when it tries compacting the thread, but fails for an \"unknown reason\". Other times it hits a usage limit, but doesn't offer any instruction to continue, just cuts off and leaves a blank response.\n\nI've seen it suggest starting a new thread to continue which makes sense for longer conversations, but sometimes it happens on the very first response which makes no sense. It seems to happen more frequently when including file attachments vs text only prompts, but it does happen in both cases. It's frustrating because it fills up my Usage pretty quickly, even when it fails to deliver a final response, which almost seems predatory. \n\nIn contrast, Sonnet 4.5 has never had this problem even with longer and more complex tasks, but the responses aren't as \"complete\" as I remember O",

However, it seems to lose track of various improvements through iterations of development. For example, after its first version of Python code, I noticed some issues and asked it to address them. It did it quickly. Then I noticed more issues and asked it to address them. It did it nicely too, but it sometimes forgot the previous issues and keeps repeating them.\n\nHow do you deal with this? I also noticed that it did not track its versions well. My workflow is that I use Claude Desktop as chat and then download its code into my VS Code editor. The code from Claude is clearly marked as version 4, as an example, but it still thinks it is working on version 3.4. \n\nIt seems half baked to me. ",

So, I created an open source library called Quint.\n\nQuint is a small React library that lets you build structured, deterministic interactions on top of LLMs. Instead of everything being raw text, you can define explicit choices where a click can reveal information, send structured input back to the model, or do both, with full control over where the output appears.\n\nQuint only manages state and behavior, not presentation. Therefore, you can fully customize the buttons and reveal UI through your own components and styles.\n\nThe core idea is simple: separate what the model receives, what the user sees, and where that output is rendered. This makes things like MCQs, explanations, role-play branches, and localized UI expansion predictable instead of hacky.\n\nQuint doesn’t depend on any AI provider and works even without an LLM.

But under the hood, things are getting… interesting.\nRight now, there are no ads running in ChatGPT. OpenAI says this clearly, and no credible evidence contradicts them. But thanks to beta app code, reporting from multiple outlets, and some very specific hiring choices, it’s also clear that OpenAI is actively preparing for a future where ads are possible.\nNot guaranteed. Not live. But no longer hypothetical either.\n\n# The financial reality no one really disputes\n\nRunning large AI models is absurdly expensive. Training them costs billions.

Best Figma clone and even made the best “Minecraft” by going 3D. But it fell short on the LeetCode Hard (failed immediately).\n* **GPT-5.2 Codex**: Most consistent all-rounder. Solid Pygame Minecraft, decent Figma clone,",

The state-space equations are the differential form of Markov recurrence. Not analogy. Homology.\n* **Constrained decoding** is Viterbi. Karpathy mentions vibe coding.

The pitch seems to be moving away from pure output-based checks and toward decoding internal activations to surface hidden goals, reasoning traces, or misalignment. If activation-level “model diffing” can actually show how newer checkpoints diverge internally from older ones, that feels like a real step beyond black-box heuristics… at least in theory.\nFrom an open-weights angle, I’m curious how much of this is already doable:\nHas anyone here tried activation-level probing for goals or intent on LLaMA / Mistral / Qwen?\nCould existing tools like SAEs, logit lens, activation patching, or simple probing classifiers be pushed in this direction, rathe",

So, I created an open source library called Quint.\n\nQuint is a small React library that lets you build structured, deterministic interactions on top of LLMs. Instead of everything being raw text, you can define explicit choices where a click can reveal information, send structured input back to the model, or do both, with full control over where the output appears.\n\nQuint only manages state and behavior, not presentation. Therefore, you can fully customize the buttons and reveal UI through your own components and styles.\n\nThe core idea is simple: separate what the model receives, what the user sees, and where that output is rendered. This makes things like MCQs, explanations, role-play branches, and localized UI expansion predictable instead of hacky.\n\nQuint doesn’t depend on any AI provider and works even without an LLM.

    "content": "It's about to be 2026 and we're still stuck in the CLI era when it comes to chatbots. So, I created an open source library called Quint.\n\nQuint is a small React library that lets you build structured, deterministic interactions on top of LLMs. Instead of everything being raw text, you can define explicit choices where a click can reveal information, send structured input back to the model, or do both, with full control over where the output appears.\n\nQuint only manages state and behavior, not presentation. Therefore, you can fully customize the buttons and reveal UI through your own components and styles.\n\nThe core idea is simple: separate what the model receives, what the user sees, and where that output is rendered. This makes things like MCQs, explanations, role-play branches, and localized UI expansion predictable instead of hacky.\n\nQuint doesn’t depend on any AI provider and works even without an LLM. All model interaction happens through callbacks, so you can plug in OpenAI, Gemi",

We found that Anthropic Opus 4.5 and Gemni 3 Pro both performed similarly at this task, but Gemini 3 Pro is much cheaper and faster. This has a static/cacheable prompt that is primarily api documentation and details on previously seen issues.\n\nThen we use Anthropic Opus 4.5 to code the app. We have tested this step on Gemini 3 Pro as well and possibly could switch to it in the future to save money.

When you relocate a project, it loses track of it because the path no longer matches.\n\nI wrote a simple bash script that fixes this:\n\n**What it does:**\n- Lists all your Claude Code projects\n- Lets you select one and enter the new path\n- Updates all path references in the `.jsonl` session files\n- Renames the metadata folder to match the new location\n- Optionally creates a backup before making changes\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n./claude-project-mover.sh\n```\n\nThe script validates that the destination folder exists before proceeding, so you won't accidentally break anything.\n\nFree and open source (MIT).

I really missed working with Claude Code CLI, which I use regularly in my work machine.\n\nSo I built a small workaround - I wrote a lightweight proxy that lets Claude Code tool talk directly to the Claude models inside Antigravity.\n\nNPM Link: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/antigravity-claude-proxy?activeTab=readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antigravity-claude-proxy?activeTab=readme)[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1pw7bv2)",

However, if I don't give claude atleast all the files associated with an Act of the novel, it seems to not grasp the context. So I have to give it anywhere from 10-15 chapters at a time and that in and of itself is using up tokens and session limits.

I bounced between random blog posts, YouTube videos and old Reddit threads, but it was still surprisingly hard to get a clean, end‑to‑end picture of “here is a solid local coding setup, start here\n\n[Github](https://github.com/murataslan1/local-ai-coding-guide)\n\nI’d really appreciate:\n\n* Reports of your own setups (GPU / RAM / model / quant + whether it’s usable for serious coding).\n* Suggestions for models or runners that should absolutely be included but aren’t yet (LM Studio, LocalAI, etc.).​\n* Any “gotchas” you hit when trying to replace Copilot‑style cloud tools with local models.\n\nIf this kind of practical, end‑to‑end guide is actually useful for the community, I’m happy to keep iterating on it based on feedback here.​​\n\n​",

    "content": "I've been diving into Java as a learning project, and coming from a Python background (where I've used libraries like PydanticAI and LangGraph), I wanted to challenge myself with something ambitious: building an agentic AI library in Java.\nAfter playing with **LangChain4J** and **Spring AI**, I found the learning curve steeper than expected—especially around patterns like agent instantiation, structured outputs, and streaming. The concepts felt quite different from their Python counterparts, and I kept thinking: \"I wish there was something more intuitive for someone like me.\"\nSo instead of just complaining, I built something. It was as much a learning exercise as anything else.\n---\n## The Pain Points I Tried to Solve\nHere's what tripped me up when learning Java AI frameworks:\n**1. Agent orchestration felt complex**\nI wanted something closer to what I'd seen in Python—easy handoffs between agents, routing, running things in parallel.\n**2. Human-in-the-loop per tool (not globally)**\nMost",

    "content": "[Celeste AI](https://github.com/withceleste/celeste-python) is a unified, standard python sdk for Multi Modal AI\n\nMost \"unified\" libraries focus on LLMs (Text). Celeste is capability agnostic. It provides the same strict, type-safe primitives for Text, Image, Audio, Video, Embeddings and more.\n\nIt solves the fragmentation of vendor SDKs by standardizing the I/O layer. It is not a framework—no agents, no chains, no hidden prompts.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\n* Capability Agnostic: Generative AI isn't just text anymore. I needed a single pattern that works for generating JSON with Claude, images with Flux, or speech with ElevenLabs.\n* Ultra Lightweight -No dependency: I didn't wrap python SDKs. I used pure httpx and pydantic. This avoids the version conflicts that come with installing 5 different vendor libraries.\n* Native vs Proxy: Unlike LiteLLM (which is a great proxy), this is a native Python library. You get full IDE autocomplete and type safety right in your code.\n\nUsage (Same Pattern, Any",

Last night I had two instances of Code running on two different git worktrees, implementing two large features in 10 minutes in parallel that would've taken me multiple hours.\n\nNow, I know how to build this engine myself.

    "content": "i’m building a system, our system is a state machine: a Retrieval Agent that tries multiple search strategies, a Validation Agent that checks for hallucinations, and an Access Control Layer that hard‑blocks unauthorized data. Basically defense in depth applied to AI.\n\nWe’re considering using Perplexity Spaces exclusively as the retrieval layer instead of Claude. Has anyone actually done this in production?\n\nCurious about determinism, auditability, access control, and failure modes when Spaces sit inside a multi‑agent pipeline?\n\nWould love to hear real‑world experiences, good or bad.",
